Players can choose from Single Zero, Double Zero, and even Triple Zero variations. The minimum bet at physical roulette tables typically starts at $5, while electronic roulette terminals allow bets from $1. A straight-up bet on a single number pays 35 to 1, meaning a $10 bet could return $360. Combination bets like splits, corners, and streets offer lower payouts but higher chances of winning.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<h4 style = \"font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;\">Blackjack<\/h4>\n<p>\n    Blackjack is a favorite among strategy players. At The Star Brisbane, the minimum bet for blackjack tables is usually $20 per hand, with maximum limits reaching $500 on standard tables. Blackjack pays 3:2, so a $20 bet on a winning blackjack hand returns $50. Side bets and variations like Trilux Blackjack add extra excitement and payout opportunities.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<h4 style = \"font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;\">Poker<\/h4>\n<p>\n    The Star Brisbane hosts the only professionally dealt cash poker games in the city, along with major tournaments such as the Brisbane Champs. Tournament buy-ins range from $240 for satellites to $1,000 for main events, while cash games offer flexible limits for all player levels. Skilled players can win thousands in a single session, especially during championship events.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<h4 style = \"font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;\">Slot Machines (Pokies)<\/h4>\n<p>\n    The casino features hundreds of slot machines, including popular titles like Lightning Link and Dragon Link. Minimum bets start at $0.01 per line, but most machines allow bets from $1 per spin. Progressive jackpots can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars, making pokies one of the most thrilling options for big wins. In Queensland, maximum bets on pokies in casinos have no strict limit, and payouts can be massive.\n<\/p>\n<br>\n\n<h4 style = \"font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;\">Baccarat and Dice Games<\/h4>\n<p>\n    Baccarat tables cater to both casual players and high rollers, with minimum bets starting around $20 and maximum limits reaching several thousand dollars.
